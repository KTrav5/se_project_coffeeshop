# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

My plan for improving this webpage would be to add images of the menu items for a visual reference. I would also like to implement an online ordering system so students can order their drinks/food on the go between classes.
